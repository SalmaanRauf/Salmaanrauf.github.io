### CPSC 120
* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite for me because it was my first time being able to create a program with a complete understanding of all the components. Being that I have not coded before this class, learning to use the strings and be able to make my own program was a surreal experience. I learned the basics of inputting and outputting, like which way the < symbol faces and all the spacing requirements. I also learned how to use strings appropriately and call them to make a complete sentence. I really liked this lab because I understood everything that I was doing and was able to figure out my errors on my own.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was also a favorite for me because it was my first time getting to calculate. In this lab, I learned about the proper applications of float and how to call the values to do a calculation. This was also the first time that I independently wrote an if-then statement which was also a fun and crucial experience. I also really liked this lab because it was quite simple and easy, and I was well-prepared and knowledgeable so I didn’t struggle.
  
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was also another of my favorite coding assignments. This lab taught us to write function definitions, which in my opinion was a challenging, but fun experience. This was also one of my first interactions with the void function and I was happy to learn about it. I also recall how we were able to store all of our data in one place so we didn’t have to keep repeating it which I also really appreciated because it sped up my workflow. I’d have to say my favorite aspect of this lab was learning how to design the functions so I could easily and effectively call upon them which I use all the time now.
